Finding mould in your home is always a disheartening discovery. Whether it's creeping into the bathroom grout, lurking in the laundry, or appearing on the silicone seals of your windows, that familiar black spotting is a problem no homeowner wants to deal with. Not only is it an eyesore, but it can also pose health risks and cause permanent damage if left untreated.

Like many Australians, I've tried countless remedies—from DIY vinegar solutions to harsh chemical sprays—with mixed results. The mould would often disappear for a few weeks, only to return with a vengeance. So, when I started seeing ads for NuroClean and its promises of a permanent fix, I was intrigued but sceptical. Could this be the solution I was looking for?

I decided to put NuroClean to the test. This is my honest review of both the NuroClean Mold Remover Gel and the NuroClean Tablets, detailing my experience and helping you decide if this is the right product for your home.

What is NuroClean?
------------------

NuroClean has gained a lot of attention for its powerful mold removal products. Unlike traditional cleaners that often just bleach the surface, NuroClean claims to penetrate deep to eliminate mould at its source, preventing it from coming back. The brand has two main products to tackle different mould problems:

### NuroClean Mold Remover Gel

The **NuroClean Gel** is designed for targeted application. It comes in a squeezable tube with a nozzle, making it easy to apply to specific areas.

**Key Features:**

*   **Thick, No-Drip Formula:** The gel is thick enough to cling to vertical surfaces, ceilings, and silicone seals without running or dripping.
    
*   **Fast-Acting:** It promises to break down and remove mould stains quickly, with visible results in as little as two hours.
    
*   **Works on All Surfaces:** The NuroClean website states the gel is safe for tiles, grout, wood, plastic, metal, and more.
    
*   **Long-Lasting Results:** By killing mould at the root, it prevents regrowth.
    

The NuroClean Gel seems perfect for those stubborn mould lines in the shower, around sinks, or on window seals where sprays are often ineffective.

### NuroClean Tablets

The **NuroClean Tablets** are designed for larger, more widespread mould issues. You dissolve them in water to create a powerful cleaning solution that can be used in washing machines to treat mouldy clothes and linens, or as a spray for larger surface areas like walls and ceilings.

**Key Features:**

*   **Versatile Application:** Ideal for laundry, cleaning large surfaces, and even mopping floors.
    
*   **Prevents Cross-Contamination:** Helps stop mould from spreading in the wash.
    
*   **Odor Neutralization:** Aims to remove the musty smells associated with mould and mildew.
    

Together, the Gel and Tablets seem to offer a complete system for tackling any mould problem a home might face.

Putting NuroClean to the Test
-----------------------------

To give NuroClean a proper trial, I identified two problem areas in my Sydney apartment that have been a constant source of frustration.

1.  **The Bathroom Shower:** The silicone sealant around the base of my shower had developed dark, stubborn black mould that no amount of scrubbing could remove. This seemed like the perfect job for the **NuroClean Mold Remover Gel**.
    
2.  **The Laundry Room:** A few towels left damp for too long had developed that unmistakable musty smell and a few small mildew spots. I decided to use the **NuroClean Tablets** in my front-loader washing machine to see if they could rescue my linens.
    

My methodology was simple: follow the instructions on the packaging exactly and document the before-and-after results.

Performance and Results
-----------------------

Here’s a detailed breakdown of how each NuroClean product performed in my real-world test.

### NuroClean Gel Review: The Shower Showdown

**Ease of Use:** Applying the NuroClean Gel was incredibly straightforward. The nozzle allowed for precise application along the mouldy silicone lines. The gel’s thick consistency was impressive; it clung to the vertical surfaces and corners of the shower without a single drip. I applied a generous layer, ensuring the mould was completely covered, and left it to work its magic.

**Effectiveness:** The instructions suggested leaving it for up to two hours. I checked after about 90 minutes and was amazed. The black stains were visibly fading. After the full two hours, I wiped the gel away with a damp cloth, and the results were stunning. The mould was completely gone. The silicone looked almost brand new. There was no need for any scrubbing, which was a huge plus.

**Safety:** I made sure to ventilate the bathroom by opening a window, but I was pleased that the gel didn't have the overwhelmingly harsh chemical smell that many other mould killers have. It felt much safer to use in an enclosed space.

### NuroClean Tablets Review: The Laundry Rescue

**Ease of Use:** Using the NuroClean Tablets was just as simple. I placed the musty towels in the washing machine, dropped one tablet directly into the drum as instructed, and ran a normal hot water cycle.

**Effectiveness:** When the cycle finished, I was greeted by towels that smelled genuinely fresh and clean. The musty odour was completely gone, not just masked by fragrance. The small mildew spots had also vanished. The tablets seemed to have deep-cleaned the fabric, restoring the towels to their former glory.

**My Verdict:** The NuroClean products delivered on their promises. Both the Gel and Tablets were highly effective, easy to use, and provided results that other products have failed to achieve. The no-scrub formula of the gel is a game-changer for bathroom cleaning.

NuroClean Gel vs. Tablets: Which One Do You Need?
-------------------------------------------------

After testing both, it's clear that the NuroClean Gel and Tablets are designed for different jobs.

*   **Choose NuroClean Gel for:** Targeted mould removal on surfaces like tile grout, silicone sealant, window frames, and around sinks. It’s perfect for visible mould lines that need a precise, powerful treatment.
    
*   **Choose NuroClean Tablets for:** Treating mould on fabrics, cleaning large surface areas, and eliminating musty odours in your washing machine.
